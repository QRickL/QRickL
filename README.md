## My Journey from Art to Math

As a kid, I wanted to be a cartoonist -- there was something so magical about telling stories with pictures. So I drew all day, every day. I hated math because it was useless and took time away from drawing. That's how I felt until COVID hit.

In the first week of remote lessons, I learned to graph the equation of a line. So... I just drew something... using math. Huh???

I ran ahead and explored other equations. Secant was really cool; its asymptotes blew my mind. Taylor series were even cooler; you're saying every function is a polynomial*? Now I was super invested. I need to know more.

My mind was blown again when I saw functions of multiple variables. You can draw in 3d with math too??? This was in grade 12, where I had the special opportunity to take a multivariable calculus course at [UBC](https://www.math.ubc.ca).

Since college applications were around the corner, I followed my curiosity and applied to some math programs for university.

Now I'm at Waterloo, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Mathematics and learning about mathematics' numerous applications beyond drawing cool pictures.

Turns out, math wasn't useless after all.
