I was thinking!

## My Journey Art -> Math

Growing up, I always thought I would be an artist. I was inspired by comics like Calvin and Hobbes, Pearls Before Swine, Garfield, and Big Nate. I spent all my time drawing in elementary and middle school, hoping to bring humour and epic tales to my classmates the same way those big name cartoonists did. Math was an afterthought during these years - solving equations took time away from drawing. However, the COVID pandemic turned my whole worldview upside down. For the first week of remote lessons, we had to teach ourselves. One thing I learned by myself was how to graph the equation of a line. Once I did it, it hit me. I just used math to draw something. Could math be fun after all?

From there, I explored other equations. I was amazed when I saw secant for the first time, and jumped out of my seat when I learned about Taylor series. So starting in high school, I shifted my creative focus to math. In grade 12, I had the special opportunity to dual enrol at the University of British Columbia and learn about multivariable calculus. Seeing math in 3D made me love it even more, and cemented my plans to study math in university. So now I find myself at the University of Waterloo pursuing a Bachelor of Mathematics, and I couldn't be happier.
